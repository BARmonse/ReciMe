# üç≥ ReciMe - Recipe Management API

A Spring Boot REST API for managing and searching recipes with PostgreSQL database support.

## Some Technical Decisions:

### 1. **PostgreSQL for Ingredients as Arrays**
- Ingredients are stored as `text[]` arrays in PostgreSQL for flexible, efficient storage and querying.

### 2. **Native SQL for Advanced Search**
- Ingredient search uses a native SQL query with `unnest` and `LIKE` for partial, case-insensitive matching.
- AND logic is enforced so all search terms must be present in the recipe's ingredients.
- This approach is more efficient and expressive than JPA Criteria API for array operations. Also it's less code haha.

### 3. **@ModelAttribute for Search DTO**
- The search endpoint uses `@ModelAttribute` to automatically bind query parameters to a DTO, supporting multiple values and type conversion.
- Simplifies controller code and improves maintainability.

### 4. **Flyway for Database Migrations**
- Ensures consistent schema management.
